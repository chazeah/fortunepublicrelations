    <p>In addition to our many professional association memberships and activities, Fortune PR is active in the Bay Area community. We participate in Halloween Heroes, a "trick-or-treat party" to benefit the Wender Weis Foundation for Children. Together with our clients, we are also active in the KGO Cure-A-Thon, which benefits the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.</p>
    <p>We have provided public relations support for the Alliance for Aging Research and for the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. We worked to establish the Asian Chefs Association by providing two years of pro bono public relations services.</p>
    <p>We run an educational internship program in association with numerous colleges in the U.S. and abroad, through which we teach students about the business of public relations. For many years we also took an active role in keeping our community clean by sponsoring litter removal along a two-mile stretch of the freeway I-80.</p>
    <p>Fortune PR undertakes these community-building activities in order to set an example, and we invite you to find a way to give back to your community as well!</p>
